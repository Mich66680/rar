      <h2>Сonnie</h2>
    <p>Connie used to be one of the shorter members of the Survey Corps, standing two centimeters shorter than Levi Ackerman. He has a slim build, with gray eyes, and his brown hair is distinctively kept shaved. Connie is typically dressed in standard military garb, and will don the Survey Corps cape when on missions.

His casual attire consists of a simple long-sleeve white shirt and shin-length brown slacks. </p>

      <h2>Sasha</h2>
      <p>Sasha was a young woman with light gold eyes and brunette hair originally kept in a ponytail that reached the base of her neck. Her bangs were slightly parted to the left, cascading down each side of her face and stopped around the middle of her neck. On missions, she wore the standard Survey Corps uniform with a light gray shirt underneath. When not on missions, she wore a simple long sleeved blouse with a skirt that slightly covered her boots. On some occasions, she even wore a sleeveless vest over her blouse.[7] She had a slender figure and was of average height. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="post">
      <h2>Elena</h2>
      <p>Yelena is a very tall woman with her blonde hair styled in a short bob with straight bangs. She has large black eyes, thick eyelashes and somewhat androgynous features due to her build and style. She also sports a chinstrap beard, which is later revealed to be fake. Originally, Yelena wore the standard Marleyan military uniform, but after disaffiliating she began wearing a casual white button-down with a dark blazer and pants. </p>
