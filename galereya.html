      <h2>Mikasa</h2>
      <p>Mikasa is a fairly tall and well-toned woman. She is of partial Asian heritage, with pale skin, gray eyes, and shaggy black hair that was long until she cut it to chin-length. After her parents were murdered by human traffickers, Mikasa was rescued by Eren Yeager and lived with him and his parents, Grisha and Carla, before the fall of Wall Maria. She is the last descendant of the Shogun clan that stayed on Paradis Island, thereby related to the Azumabito family, and holds significant political power in Hizuru.[12]By the year 854, her hair is shorter and cut up to the back of her neck, though she simultaneously wears noticeably longer bangs. She bears a tattoo of the Azumabito family crest on the outside of her right wrist. There is a small scar below her right eye, which was due to an injury delivered by Eren's Titan during the Battle of Trost District.[13] By 857, Mikasa's hair grew noticeably long and is tied in a ponytail.[14]

Mikasa often wears the original Survey Corps uniform, whose equipment is horizontally at her hips, with a white blouse underneath and a black scarf that she almost always wears.[15] She also wears a green cape with the wings of freedom on the back during some missions.

When off duty, Mikasa's casual attire consists of a simple knee-length white dress, a light cardigan, brown boots, and her signature black scarf.</p>
